# Digital Tissue Image Analysis Application

An application developed for the analysis of digital tissue images using the TIA library, created as part of a **master's thesis**.

## Overview

This application provides a comprehensive solution for the analysis of digital tissue images, with a focus on automating the process and offering valuable insights to researchers and medical professionals.

## Features

- **Backend:** Implemented using Flask for seamless integration with the TIA toolbox and efficient data processing.

- **Graphical Interface:** Developed with Next.js to enhance the user experience and facilitate intuitive interaction.

## Application Goals

The primary goal of this application is to automate the tissue analysis process and provide meaningful insights to researchers and medical experts.

## Presentation

The application was presented at the **SoftCOM conference** as part of a research paper, showcasing its capabilities and contributions to the field.

## Technologies Used

- Flask
- TIA toolbox
- Next.js
- JavaScript

## Getting Started

To run the application locally, you'll need to set up both the frontend and the backend.

### Backend Setup (Flask)

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

2. Install backend dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the Flask development server:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

   The backend server should now be running at `http://localhost:5000`.

### Frontend Setup (Next.js)

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

2. Install frontend dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the Next.js development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

   The frontend server should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

Now, you should have both the backend and frontend running locally. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to interact with the application.
